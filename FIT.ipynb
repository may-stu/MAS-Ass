    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "In this project we implement a tabular Q‐learning solution for a two‐agent pickup‐and‐dropoff task on a 5×5 grid. Agents incur a penalty for head‐on collisions and receive a reward for successful deliveries. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a **GridWorld** environment class.  \n",
    "2. Encapsulate reward logic in a **RewardStructure** class.  \n",
    "3. Implement a **QLearningAgent** with ε‐greedy policy and decay.  \n",
    "4. Train with **early stopping** once a target success rate is reached within 1,000,000 agent‐steps.  \n",
    "5. Compare two ε‐decay schedules and visualise results.  \n",
    "6. Fully document design choices, results, and limitations.\n"
